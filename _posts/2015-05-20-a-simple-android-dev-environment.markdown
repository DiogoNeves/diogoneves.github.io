This isn't a post per se, but a short list of Software that may be useful if
you're starting your Android Development quest.  

* IDE - [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/tools/studio/index.html)
* UI Test-kit - [Espresso](https://code.google.com/p/android-test-kit/wiki/Espresso)
* Emulator - [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/#!/)
* Versioning - [GitHub](https://github.com/)
* A Brain - [Motivation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation)


What isn't here but I'd appreciate suggestions:  

* Continuous Testing on multiple distributions
* UI Mockups & Prototyping

_Note: I may edit this post with more tools whenever I find them_
