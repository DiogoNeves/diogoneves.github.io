description: Read and execute instructions from compiler/instructions.md step by step
---

Read the file `compiler/instructions.md` and execute the instructions contained within it step by step.

For each instruction:

- Parse and understand what needs to be done
- Execute the instruction completely
- Verify completion before moving to the next step
- Report progress and any errors encountered

If the instructions file is empty or doesn't exist, inform the user.
If you need clarification on a step, ask the user directly!

Once completed, increment the version in \_layouts/game.html when importing the script.
