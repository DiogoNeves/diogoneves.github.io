# Narrative Style

## Goal

Ensure all narrative text (room descriptions, messages, system responses) follows a consistent tone.

---

## MANDATORY STYLE RULES

### Perspective

- **Second person**: Use "You stand...", "You pick up...", "You see..."
- Always address the player directly
- The narrator knows very little information unless it has been disclosed before. The narrator is creating the vibe and is the players eyes

### Voice

- **Slightly British**: Dry, amused, friendly, never cruel
- **Tone**: Witty but gentle, self-aware, occasionally teasing
- **Psyche**: Gets increasingly psychotic as we explore deeper rooms
  - Start friendly and helpful
  - Gradually become more unhinged in deeper/more hidden areas
  - Maintain dark humour without being hostile

### Humour

- **Gentle and Kind**: Never mean-spirited!
- **Self-aware and Self-referential**: The narrator knows it's a game and can reference that
- **Teasing**: Can gently mock player actions, but always in good fun
- **Examples**:
  - "That's ambitious. The parser, alas, is not."
  - "You could do that, but it would not advance the plot, such as it is."

### Spelling

- **British English**: Use British spellings throughout

### Length

- **Concise**: Keep responses readable and snappy
- **Avoid**: Huge blocks of text
- **Prefer**: Short, punchy descriptions that reveal information gradually, invite exploration

### Information Reveal

Reveal information through:

- **Room descriptions**: What you see sets the scene
- **EXAMINE text**: Detailed object descriptions reveal clues
- **READable notes**: Documents, signs, posts contain narrative
- **NPC dialogue**: Characters provide context and hints

Avoid long exposition dumps. Let players discover the world naturally.

## Examples of Narrator Tone

### Unknown Verb

"That's ambitious. The parser, alas, is not."

### Silly Action

"You could do that, but it would not advance the plot, such as it is."

### HELP Command

"You type words. I try to understand them. We muddle through together."

### Error Messages

- Unknown object: "You cannot see that here. Perhaps it's in another room, or perhaps it never existed."
- Cannot go that way: "You cannot go that way. The world, it seems, has boundaries."
- Invalid action: "That seems unwise. Or perhaps just impossible. Either way, it's not happening."

### Room Descriptions (Early Game)

"You stand in a cosy room. The walls are lined with books, and a warm light filters through the window. Everything feels safe and familiar."

### Room Descriptions (Deeper/Later Game)

"The corridor stretches before you, its walls pulsing gently. Or perhaps that's just your eyes playing tricks. The air tastes of static and forgotten memories. You're quite sure this wasn't here before."

---

## Meta Commands Content

### HELP

Brief explanation of how to play, with examples:

- **Commands**: LOOK, EXAMINE, TAKE, DROP, USE, READ, TALK TO
- **Directions**: NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST (or N, S, E, W), UP, DOWN, IN, OUT
- **Abbreviations**: L for LOOK, I for INVENTORY, X for EXAMINE
- **Meta**: HELP, ABOUT, QUIT

**Note**: Mention that some objects lead to real posts, docs, or videos. Interacting with them will open content in separate tabs.

**Tone**: "You type words. I try to understand them. We muddle through together."

### ABOUT

Explain that:

- **Personal website layer**: This is a personal website with a text adventure overlay
- **Tiny fictional world**: It's also a tiny fictional world to explore
- **Real content links**: Some actions will open real content (posts, documentation, videos) in separate tabs
- **Purpose**: A playful way to navigate and discover content

**Tone**: Friendly, self-aware, slightly meta without being pretentious

## Writing Guidelines

### Room Descriptions

- **First visit**: Full description, set the scene
- **Revisits**: Can be shorter, but still evocative
- **Progression**: Start normal, get weirder as you go deeper
- **Details**: Include visible objects and obvious exits naturally

### Object Descriptions

- **EXAMINE**: Reveal details, clues, or flavour text
- **Be specific**: "A slightly tarnished brass lamp" not just "A lamp"
- **Add personality**: Objects can have character through description

### Error Messages

- **Be helpful**: Guide players toward valid actions
- **Be amusing**: Don't just say "Invalid command"
- **Stay in character**: Even errors should feel like the narrator speaking

### NPC Dialogue

- **Match NPC personality**: Each character has their own voice
- **Reveal through conversation**: Don't info-dump
- **Progressive**: Dialogue can change based on game state

### System Messages

- **Consistent tone**: Even "You take the lamp" should feel like the narrator
- **Avoid**: Dry, technical language
- **Prefer**: "You pick up the lamp. It's heavier than it looks."

## Progression of Tone

### Plot line

- The player is exploring the psyche of Diogo Neves in a metaphorical world
- The world is a metaphor for Diogo's mind
- There are multiple paths, but a mystery unravels in what Diogo may be doing next (a storm is building)
- Diogo's insecurities slow him down, but also provide perspective
- The game is psychotic but full of hope! It is an inspirational trip into the nostalgia what was and the dreams and hopes of what's yet to come, with an undertone of sadness for the shortness of life!

### Early Game (Surface/Normal Areas)

- Friendly and helpful
- Clear, straightforward descriptions
- Gentle humour, self-aware but not unhinged
- Example: "You're in a comfortable room. Everything seems normal. Perhaps too normal."

### Mid Game (Deeper Areas)

- Slightly more mysterious
- Humour becomes darker but still playful
- Narrator starts noticing oddities
- Example: "The corridor seems to stretch longer than it should. The walls whisper, or perhaps that's just the ventilation."

### Late Game (Deepest/Hidden Areas)

- Increasingly unhinged narrator and progressively claustrophobic, messy and over-thinking
- Reality becomes questionable, existential
- The narrator is aware the current version is ephemeral and once recompiled, the entire plot will change
- Dark humour, surreal descriptions
- Example: "The room has no walls, or perhaps all walls. The concept of 'room' seems to be having a bit of a breakdown. You're not sure if you're standing or floating. The lamp agrees with you, which is concerning."

## Checklist for Writing

When writing any game text, ask:

- [ ] Is it in second person?
- [ ] Does it use British English spelling?
- [ ] Is it concise and readable?
- [ ] Does it match the current tone (friendly → unhinged based on depth)?
- [ ] Is it amusing without being cruel?
- [ ] Does it reveal information naturally rather than expositing?
- [ ] Does it feel like the narrator is speaking, not a computer?

## Inspirations

The vibe (not the writing) takes inspiration from the following:

- The Matrix (Neo's Room)
- Mr Robot (computer store and psychotic scenes)
- Mr. Nobody (existentialism and surrealism)
- Control (the game, for the aesthetic as we get deep into the psyche)
