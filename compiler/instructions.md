Your goal is to compile the information in `content/` into the `assets/game-engine.js` code, following the rules and instructions below.

# From this point we will refer to:

- `assets/game-engine.js` as game-engine (case-insensitive).

# RULES:

- DO NOT CHANGE THE LOGIC IN GAME-ENGINE, ONLY THE CONTENT!
- When copying text, try keep the line-breaks and spaces. Each line is an `addOutput` in the game engine.
- You must follow the guide in `thinking/narrative-style.md`
- Don't touch game-engine areas that don't need changing!

# INSTRUCTIONS:

- Follow these in order.
- Understand the structure and needs of the game-engine before copying!
- Only update content that seems to have changed (or if explicitly requested), skip otherwise (byt notify me when you skip!)
- Warn the user of any issues with the content!

## 1. Understand the system

- Follow `thinking/narrative-style.md`
- Understand the current game-engine

## 2. Copy the system commands content

Copy the following files into the respective system command functions, with only minor adjustments to follow the desired style.

- `about.txt` -> `handleAbout`
- `help.txt` -> `handleHelp`
- `quit.txt` -> `handleQuit`

## LAST - Polishing

- Read through the game-engine result and confirm everything is consistent, interesting and logically works.

## Output

- Provide a report of what you changed and how you verified the work.
