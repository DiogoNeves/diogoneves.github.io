Diogo (see :point_up:) is a **Software Engineer @ LOST**.

He has helped improving **communications on public transport**, worked on
(BAFTA award winning) **Little Big Planet PSP, Killzone Mercenary** and
tried to dominate the world twice.
He is currently working on the **next generation of Music applications**.

Diogo spends much of his free time with **wife and daughter** in happy Cambridge.
(Mostly talking about themselves in the third person, which is impressive
with a newborn daughter!).
