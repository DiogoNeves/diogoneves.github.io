I am a father of two amazing girls and was, until recently, an **Engineering Manager @ Apple**.

I have worked as an engineer on a few different things, from Siri to the
_BAFTA award-winning_ **Little Big Planet PSP** and **Killzone Mercenary**,
venturing into smaller startups in-between.

My free time goes mostly to my **lovely family**, enjoying life, or in a dark room at night,
learning more about whatever is my current interest.
