The game starts outside, the player is facing a storefront with retro tech and flickering neon signs.

There is an NPC in this room that is extremely friendly and excited, but is warning the player that a storm seems to be coming, strange things have been happening in this town lately.

There is an easy to miss quarter on the floor, near the store front.

From this room the player can go to: the store (in front); house (across the road); train station; coast-line (near the store, opposite to the train)
