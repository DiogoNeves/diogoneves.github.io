=====
Outside
=====

The game starts outside, the player is facing a storefront with retro tech and flickering neon signs.

==State==
There is an NPC in this room that is extremely friendly and excited, but is warning the player that a storm seems to be coming, strange things have been happening in this town lately. (only disclose this information if talked to)

There is an easy to miss quarter on the floor, near the store front.

The player can read the neon sign and store name "Metaphora" (don't disclose unless the user reads the signs).

From this room the player can go to: the store (in front); house (across the road); train station; coast-line (near the store, opposite to the train)

=====
Store
=====

At the entrance, the store sells software. It has shelves with gift cards for AI codes to connect to large AI models, but also has a section with personal AI boxes. One of the boxes has a post-it hanging.
The store looks pristine but abandoned. Looks like whoever worked here left in a rush as there are piles of personal AI boxes on the floor, waiting to be moved to a shelf.
There's a counter in front, opposite to the entrance.

==State==
There's a post-it hanging on a personal AI box. It says "these are yet to happen" in messy hand-writting, barely readable.

(only if the user looks) The box of one of the personal AI boxes on the floor says "Don't use at your own risk!".

From this room:
* Behind the counter there's a door (it's locked, needs the "backdoor-key-1")
* To the left of the entrance is the retro video-game section
* To the right of the entrance is the video and content section

Store - Video-Games
=====

This section feels more creative, with poster on the wall. Mostly games, especially old ones like Tomb Raider, Final Fantasy VII, Crash Bandicoot, MediEval.
There's also a dusty large cardboard standee with bold large colourful font "Little Big Planet". Many different games are on shelves, many different copies of Little Big Planet too.

==State==

Turning one of the Little Big Planet games around shows a note in the lapidated box "once a masterpiece, left in the few who remember".

Looking closer at the standee shows "BAFTA award winning game".
