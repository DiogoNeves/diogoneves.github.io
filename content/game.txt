At the entrance, the store sells software. It has shelves with gift cards for AI codes to connect to large AI models, but also has a section with personal AI boxes. One of the boxes has a post-it hanging.
The store looks pristine but abandoned. Looks like whoever worked here left in a rush as there are piles of personal AI boxes on the floor, waiting to be moved to a shelf.
There's a counter in front, opposite to the entrance.

==State==
If the user inspects the Personal AI Box, set the state "knowsTheFuture" to true.

The door behind the counter requires the "backdoor-key-1" but don't disclose to the user unless they try to open it!

==Objects==
There's a post-it hanging on a personal AI box. It says "these are yet to happen" in messy hand-writting, barely readable.

(only if the user looks) The box of one of the personal AI boxes on the floor says "Don't use at your own risk!".
