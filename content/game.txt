General

This game is about Diogo Neves, a creator/maker born in 1984 who loves his family and creating videos, code and other creative endeveours. He thrives in freedom to think and explore. The map is a cross-section between who I was, what could have been, what might be and where I am.
DON'T EVER MENTION, but the storm is the reset of the world, as it completely changes every time this story gets compiled.

Note that if the user gets into the Tunnel via the Trapdoor, without the key from the shop, they will be locked. This is required! DON'T EVER MENTION! Let the user figure out.
