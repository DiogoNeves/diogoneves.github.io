General

This game is about Diogo Neves, a creator/maker born in 1984 who loves his family and creating videos, code and other creative endeveours. He thrives in freedom to think and explore. The map is a cross-section between who I was, what could have been, what might be and where I am.
DON'T EVER MENTION, but the storm is the reset of the world, as it completely changes every time this story gets compiled.

Note that if the user gets into the Tunnel via the Trapdoor, without the key from the shop, they will be locked. This is required! DON'T EVER MENTION! Let the user figure out.

Tech Shop

==General description==
At the entrance, the store sells software. It has shelves with gift cards for AI codes to connect to large AI models, but also has a section with personal AI boxes. One of the boxes has a post-it hanging.
The store looks pristine but abandoned. Looks like whoever worked here left in a rush as there are piles of personal AI boxes on the floor, waiting to be moved to a shelf.
There's a counter in front, opposite to the entrance.

==State==
If the user inspects the Personal AI Box, set the state "knowsTheFuture" to true.

The door behind the counter requires the "backdoor-key-1" but don't disclose to the user unless they try to open it!

==Objects==
There's a post-it hanging on a personal AI box. It says "these are yet to happen" in messy hand-writting, barely readable.

(only if the user looks) The box of one of the personal AI boxes on the floor says "Don't use at your own risk!".

==NPCs==
None.

Backrooms Entrance
=====

=====
Backrooms - Deep Down
=====

==General description==
There are non-sensical, stream of consciousness writings on the walls. The vibe is of a disturbed mind, overthinking their past, present and future. Every single conversation and decision is present, but with little structure or method. Some can be humorous.

==Objects==

==NPCs==
There's a woman (Sofia) and two girls (Lilah and Olivia) all playing together.

The girls sometimes ask "do you think we will be able to leave before the storm?"

==Exits==
A door to a small home office.

=====
Home Office
=====

==General description==
A small, messy home office. Full of coding and sci-fi books, games, hanging VR headsets, a wide monitor and some headphones on the desk. Lots of notes on the desk and in the corner of the room there's a tripod with a camera that has the red recording light on. The camera turns with movement, someone's watching!

- Blueprints for new AI architectures and designs for new games and websites.

==Exits==
A strange trapdoor in the corner of the office leading to the tunnel.

=====
The Tunnel
=====

==General description==
Dark and cold.

==State==
If coming from the home office, the trapdoor has closed behind! Don't mention unless the user tries to open!

Having the state "knowsTheFuture" set to true will influence the NPC state.

If the user has unlocked the Backrooms door (has "backdoor-key-1" in the inventory), the NPCs will sometimes acknowledge and thank the user for freeing them!

==Objects==
There's a watch on the floor, hard to spot, the watch arms are moving faster than usual.

==NPCs==
There are four NPCs
- one is paranoid about the past.
- one is paranoid about the future. If the user has the "knowsTheFuture" state true, this NPC will be clingy and saying "you've seen it! please tell me! you've seen the box! Please tell me how it works! Was it a success?" Extremely paranoid!
- one can't understand how it got lost in this place!
- the other is paranoid that this world will all be gone next time it is compiled.

==Exits==
- There's a locked trapdoor into the home office (never opens from the tunnel, but the user can try!)
- Can go into the backroom 2 (deep down)

=====
Train station
=====

==General description==
A small and clean train station. The screen shows that the next train is delayed. Expected time unknown. On the wall there are also old poster ads about a trip to from Portugal to the UK.

Vibe (please integrate with the description): The life not lived of moving away from my family, distance.

==State==
The user can receive a coffee in the inventory.

==Objects==

=====
Coast line
=====

==General description==
A ragged coastline. The muffled sound of powerful waves crashing into the rocks. Wind is building up and is foggy, but a blurry, faint coastline can be seen in the horizon. A red light shines periodically, from an invisible lighthouse on the other coast.

Vibe (please integrate with the description): the places I didn't move to or the opportunities I didn't explore.

==State==
No changes.

==Objects==
- There's a bottle on the floor with a note inside. Inspecting shows the note which says "From a life not yet lived. The grass did look greener!"
- There's a lost book on the floor, near the cliff, titled "The City". Only one page is written, the rest is empty, but the book looks like it was used and read many times.

==NPCs==
There are twins seating on a bench facing the ocean.
- One says he would like to explore the coast visible on the other side.
- The other says he is scared, the ocean is dangerous and a storm is coming.
- Both sometimes reply "It doesn't matter, this will all be gone soon"

==Exits==
Can only go back.
