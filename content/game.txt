Outside
=====

The game starts outside, the player is facing a storefront with retro tech and flickering neon signs.

==State==
No state changes

==Objects==
An easy to miss quarter on the floor, near the store front.

The player can read the neon sign and store name "Metaphora" (don't disclose unless the user reads the signs).

==NPCs==
There is an NPC that is extremely friendly and excited, but is warning the player that a storm seems to be coming, strange things have been happening in this town lately. (only disclose this information if talked to)

==Exits==
The tech shop (in front)
The house (across the road)
The train station
The coast-line (near the shop, opposite to the train)

=====
Tech Shop
=====

At the entrance, the store sells software. It has shelves with gift cards for AI codes to connect to large AI models, but also has a section with personal AI boxes. One of the boxes has a post-it hanging.
The store looks pristine but abandoned. Looks like whoever worked here left in a rush as there are piles of personal AI boxes on the floor, waiting to be moved to a shelf.
There's a counter in front, opposite to the entrance.

==State==
If the user inspects the Personal AI Box, set the state "knowsTheFuture" to true.

The door behind the counter requires the "backdoor-key-1" but don't disclose to the user unless they try to open it!

==Objects==
There's a post-it hanging on a personal AI box. It says "these are yet to happen" in messy hand-writting, barely readable.

(only if the user looks) The box of one of the personal AI boxes on the floor says "Don't use at your own risk!".

==NPCs==
None.

==Exits==
Behind the counter there's a door (it's locked, needs the "backdoor-key-1")
To the left of the entrance is the retro video-game section
To the right of the entrance is the video and content section

Store - Video-Games

This section feels more creative, with poster on the wall. Mostly games, especially old ones like Tomb Raider, Final Fantasy VII, Crash Bandicoot, MediEval.
There's also a dusty large cardboard standee with bold large colourful font "Little Big Planet". Many different games are on shelves, many different copies of Little Big Planet too.

==State==

Turning one of the Little Big Planet games around shows a note in the lapidated box "once a masterpiece, left in the few who remember".

Looking closer at the standee shows "BAFTA award winning game".
