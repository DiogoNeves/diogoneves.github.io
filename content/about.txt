ABOUT THIS PLACE

This is my website, or perhaps it's a text adventure in my mind. The distinction blurs.

I'm Diogo. I build things: games, systems, experiments. Code is a form of expression for me. A shapeshifter tool I play with not quite knowing where I'm going, half of the time.

Feel free to explore. Some actions will open real content: blog posts, documentation, videos; just be careful not to get lost.

The engine is entirely client-side JavaScript. No servers were harmed in the making of this adventure.
I built this to explore the limits of my collaboration with AI. It feels mine and not at the same time.

It treats the LLM as a creative compiler, I still edit the source.

Have fun!
