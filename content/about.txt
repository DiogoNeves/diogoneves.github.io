ABOUT THIS PLACE

This is a personal website wearing a text adventure costume. Or perhaps it's a text adventure that happens to contain a personal website. The distinction blurs.

I'm Diogo. I build things — games, systems, experiments. This place is a playful way to explore that. Some actions will open real content: blog posts, documentation, videos. Think of it as navigation through the medium of curiosity.

The engine is entirely client-side JavaScript. No servers were harmed in the making of this adventure. The code is probably on GitHub, because where else would it be?
